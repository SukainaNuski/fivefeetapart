While realistic and sardonic about her illness, Stella is willing to do whatever it takes to stay alive for as long as possible, especially since her parents divorced after the death of her sister Abby. Stella knows how to code and built an app to set custom reminders for people living with chronic illnesses. Despite her initial dislike of Will and the dangers of being physically near him, Stella falls in love with Will</p>

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>Stella Grant and Will Newman both have cystic fibrosis (CF) and must stay six feet apart due to their compromised immune systems. Stella is meticulous about her treatments, while Will, who is part of a drug trial and infected with B. cepacia, is more rebellious. As they bond over their shared struggles, their relationship deepens into love.</p><br>
        <p>Despite their feelings, Stella’s G-tube infection requires surgery, and she faces it alone after learning her sister Abby died a year ago. Will supports her by singing Abby’s song. Later, nurse Barb warns Will about the dangers of breaking the six-foot rule. Realizing the risk, Will decides to end their relationship to protect Stella.</p><br>
        <p>On Will's birthday, after Poe, Stella's CF friend, dies, Stella and Will leave the hospital to see lights she’s always dreamed of. Stella falls through ice but is saved by Will, who performs CPR despite the infection risk. Stella survives and undergoes a successful lung transplant. Will, knowing he might have infected her, says a final goodbye, leaving her his sketchbook of drawings.</p>
